# AR-VR-Tangible-Interactions
Created infrared (IR) camera and light attachments for Microsoft Hololens 1 and Oculus Quest 2. SolidWorks and STEP files are provided for CAD models (Hardware>IR_Camera_Apparatus>Microsoft_Hololens_1/Oculus_Quest_2). KiCad files are provided for the PCB and schematic of a compact IR light circuit (Hardware>IR_Camera_Apparatus>IR_Light). 

Programmed computer vision algorithms in Python to detect AruCo codes inside a custom-designed Ping Pong Paddle and Lightsaber. STL files are provided for the empty models and AruCo codes (Hardware>Ping_Pong_Paddle/Lightsaber). 

Mapped object movements to play:
- [Konterball](https://konterball.com/) in a web XR environment using 2D-to-3D conversion system assisted by PyAutoGUI (Software>Konterball).
- [Fruit Ninja](https://github.com/zigurous/unity-fruit-ninja-tutorial) in a wired PC-VR environment using C# scripts in Unity (Sofware>Fruit_Ninja).
